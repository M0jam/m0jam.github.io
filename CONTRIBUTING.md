### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to PlayHub? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

- **Good first issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### TypeScript / JavaScript Styleguide

- We use **ESLint** and **Prettier** to enforce code style.
- Run `npm run lint` before committing to ensure your code matches the project style.
- Prefer functional components and hooks for React.
- Use explicit types for TypeScript whenever possible (avoid `any`).

## Pull Requests

2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
